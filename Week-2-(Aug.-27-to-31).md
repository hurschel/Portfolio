Over the course of this week, I learned the basics of Python, Kivy, and Github by working on several projects and assignments that required me to implement several important concepts. 

Monday: On the first day of the week, we were split up into our departments, and began learning about Github and how it works. Paul explained to us how Github organizes the code that is uploaded to it, and we began working with Git Bash (seen at right). We learned how to perform several basic operations and I gained a decent general understanding of how we would be using Github throughout the year. I started working on “Gitbasics1” but did not quite complete it.

Tuesday: On Tuesday, I completed the assignments “Gitbasics1” and “Gitbasics2” on Github. These assignments required me to learn how to clone a repository, create and modify a branch, commit my code, push my code to github, open a pull request, and resolve a merge conflict. I started feeling much more comfortable working with Github. Later that day, I started learning the basics of Python. Some examples of the things that I learned, like how to make for loops, classes, and objects, are shown at right.

Wednesday: On Wednesday, I put to work the Github and Python concepts that I learned in the previous days in making Pong. This also introduced me to Kivy, which we used to format the components of the game. 

Thursday: On Thursday, we were introduced to our Raspberry Pi’s, and figured out how to use them. In some downtime brought on by technical difficulties, I was able to practice some of the concepts that I had learned on previous days by messing around with Git Bash. I reviewed many Github and Python skills. We didn’t do much that day, but the plan was for us to clone a repository from Github and begin work on setting up joysticks to play Pong with.

Friday: On the last day of the week, the goal for the day was to learn how to set up a joystick to work with the Pong game that we had created. Working with my partner, I started out by finding some pre-existing joystick code that one of the mentors directed us to. I was confused for much of the day, because the majority of the code in this and in the main Python code of the game involved concepts that I didn’t fully understand. I struggled to learn what purpose “__init__” and “self” served, but I understand what they do now. My partner and I were fairly lost for the majority of the time, but I learned several more commands in Git Bash and answered almost as many questions as I asked.
