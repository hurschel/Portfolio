This week, much of my focus shifted from trying to learn new concepts to trying to implement the concepts that I had already learned into my code. That said, I still learned a lot, and my attempts to use the knowledge that I gained resulted in some valuable learning experiences.

Monday: On Monday, I spent most of my time working more on Pong. I tried changing various features of the code in both the Python file and the Kivy file and researched components of the code that I didn’t understand, such as functions like “super” and various other operations involved in the game’s code.

Tuesday: The next day, I continued to work on Pong, doing things that were similar to what I did on the previous day. 

Wednesday: I spent some of my time on Wednesday learning more from the Pong code, but I quickly transitioned to reading the PEP 8 style guide, along with a few others. I made it about halfway through the guide, and researched any concepts that I didn’t know about along the way, like docstrings and “assert” statements.

Thursday: I did the same things on Thursday that I did on Wednesday, and eventually finished reading the guide. I focused primarily on memorizing the naming and spacing conventions, which, according to Paul, were the most important things to know.

Friday: On the last day of the week, I helped Blake connect a SlushEngine to a Raspberry Pi for a second robotic arm. I spent a lot of time screwing and unscrewing things, and didn’t really learn many new things.
